                <p>Over the years, the Berok Zindagi initiative has helped create awareness about asthma and its the right treatment i.e inhalers. With this objective, we have brought together two asthmatics who have overcome the condition and proved to the world that asthmatics can achieve their dreams.</p>
                
                <p>We have partnered with 6 times Michelin Star winning chef Vikas Khanna, Arjuna award and Commonwealth Gold-winning Badminton champion Parupalli Kashyap with one of the top Bollywood actor, Ayushmann Khurrana to encourage asthmatics to use inhalers</p>
                
                <p>Through our campaign, we believe the myths and stigma surrounding inhalers will eventually fade away and every asthmatic will live a Berok Zindagi.</p>
